           <h2>Homecoming</h2>
           
           <h3>The Structure of Homecoming</h3>
           
                <p>Homecoming begins by jumping back and forth between the present and five years in the past. Heidi, the interviewer, is working at Homecoming in the past, and is working as a server being questioned by the DOD in the present.</p>
                <p>	This narrative sounds much like a movie. The way the scenes jump back and forth without much notice resemble the way films can easily cut in and out of scenes.</p>
                <p>After the recorded section of the story is finished an interview begins with the creator of the show. This is a totally different structure, and is more similar to a sitcom.</p>
           
           <h3>Who does the talking?</h3>
           
                <p>There are several characters in this section:
                </p><li>Heidi</li>
                <li>Walter</li>
                <li>Colin</li>
                <li>Thomas</li><p></p>
                <p>The main character, Heidi does most of the talking. She is in every scene, however, in each individual conversation she does less talking than the other character.</p>
           
           <h3>Is it scripted?</h3>
           
                <p>Yes, this podcast is a story so it is scripted. Despite this, it is not supposed to sound scripted. The narrative is moving with Heidi going through her life and the conversations she is having.</p>
           
           <h3>Interviews?</h3>
           
                <p>The bluk of the podcast is not an interview. However, at the end of each show the creater of the show is interviewd in an informal setting.</p>
           
           <h3>Are there sound effects and music?</h3>
           
                <li>Piano</li>
                <li>Sirens</li>
                <li>Fish Tank</li>
                <li>Phone sounds</li>
                <li>Birds</li><p></p>
           
           <h2>Radiolab</h2>
           
           <h3>Structure</h3>
           
                <p>These podcasts are set up much like an informal lecture. The lectures have several individual lecturers going off of each other in a conversational tone.</p>
                <p>The goal of these podcasts is to inform the listener of a set topic of discussion. This contrasts from the previous podcast that was a story rather than a lecture.</p>
        
          <h3>Who is talking?</h3>
           
                <p>Each lecturer talks about equally in the beginning of the first segment. But, once the actual lecture begins one of the men takes over the bulk of the conversation.</p>
                <p>In the second episode there was an actual scientists joining in on the issue of color and color blindness.</p>
          
          <h3>Is it scripted?</h3>
           
                <p>The majority of the lecture is scripted. Each speaker has set points of discussions they wish to talk about. The lecture is structured in a certain order because of this. </p>
                <p>However, since there is more than one speaker the entire conversation is not scripted. The speakers go off of each other and make comments on their peers points. </p>
           
           <h3>Interviews?</h3>
           
                <p>There are interviews in some parts of the show. However, the interview is not set up like the typical question and answer format. The lecturers have more of a conversation with their guests rather than have a static interview. </p>
                <p>The show interviewed several people over the course of the three episodes. One was a scientist discussing his work to cure colorblindness. In another part of the show one of the lecturers went into the field to conduct an experiement on several people to see if they could see more colors than the typical human. Though these could be considered interviews, they were conducted in more of a conversational manner. </p>
           
           <h3>Are there sound effects and music?</h3>
           
                <p>Yes. They used: clips from other lectures, scifi sounds, a choir, and other songs</p>
