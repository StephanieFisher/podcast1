           <h2>Homecoming</h2>
           
           <h3>Structure</h3>
           
                <p>First, the narrator introduces the show, then we jump right in with an interview between the main character and a returning vet. There is a lot of jumping around, plot wise, and I found it hard to follow at first, but was able to figure it out via contex clues.</p>
           
           <h3>Who does the talking?</h3>
           
                <p>The characters; there is no narrator.</p>
           
           <h3>Is it scripted?</h3>
           
                <p>Yes.</p>
           
           <h3>Interviews?</h3>
           
                <p>The story of the podcast seems to be based around interviews--and not just ones between the main character and the returning military people.</p>
           
           <h3>Are there sound effects and music?</h3>
           
                <p>There are a bunch of sound effects from background objects and locations that seem to be trying to immerse the viewer in the show. Not much music, though.</p>
           
           <h2>Radiolab</h2>
           
           <h3>Structure</h3>
           
                <p>This podcast is set up like a series of informal lectures and interviews with experts in their fields.</p>
        
          <h3>Who is talking?</h3>
           
                <p>The hosts first introduce the topic, then the guest, then the guest does most of the talking.</p>
          
          <h3>Is it scripted?</h3>
           
                <p>The outline of it seems to be scripted, but what the guests say isn't, as the hosts seem surprized. But they could be acting.</p>
           
           <h3>Interviews?</h3>
           
                <p>This show seems to be based around interviews with experts in the field, as each episode has someone new come in and talk about what they know.</p>
           
           <h3>Are there sound effects and music?</h3>
           
                <p>Yes. They used: clips from other lectures, scifi sounds, a choir, and other songs</p>
